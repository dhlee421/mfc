# Coil Heater Temperature Control Software

* Sensor
  - Temperature and Humidity sensor(HT-01D)
  - Heat Module - 12V
  
* Tool 
  - Visual Studio 2010, VC++/MFC
  - Atmel Studio 7
  - Atmega128
  - ISP Programmer
  - RS-232C Communication
  - I2C Interface logic by Software

This one use a ATMEL Atmega128 8bit mcu. In this project I used 12 temperature sensors same time. Actually Atmega128 support only 3 i2c channels. It use i2c function that implemented by software.
