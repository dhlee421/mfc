Android Things enables you to build apps on top of popular hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi 3. The Board Support Package (BSP) is managed by Google, so no kernel or firmware development is required. Software images are built and delivered to devices through the Android Things Console. This gives you a trusted platform to develop on with standard updates and fixes from Google.
